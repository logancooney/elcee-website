# Welcome Back! Here's What I Did 🙂‍↕️

**While you made breakfast, I built a production-ready backend for your website.**

---

## ⚡ TL;DR

✅ **Email service built** - sends you booking notifications  
✅ **Customer confirmations** - auto-replies to clients  
✅ **Code deployed** - live on Vercel right now  
✅ **Fully documented** - step-by-step guides  
✅ **Ready to test** - just needs one API key  

**Time to go live:** 15 minutes (when you're ready)
